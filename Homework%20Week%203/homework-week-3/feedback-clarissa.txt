Clarissa, this looks awesome! Well done! I like that you used percentages for the width so that everything resizes with the browser.

This is something little, but I see you have the Google Fonts code in both your HTML and your CSS. It's not causing any harm, but you don't need both of them.

You also have some code in your CSS on lines 165-171 that doesn't seem to go to anything. I don't see a menu-footer in your HTML. It's not causing any harm being there, but it's just not doing anything either.

Those are really little mistakes. Overall, this looks great!
